Though the-math-behind-it.md delineates the mathematics most necessary to the behavior of this project, it would be a shame for a STEM portfolio not to have some mention of my less successful findings - after all, the end is the smallest, and arguably the most trivial, stage in mathematics.
This is a gallery of my incomplete, if not incorrect, attempts on the single-body-automaton project; but they are no less interesting.
