$$ \textbf{Introduction} $$

Traditionally, the cellular automaton known as Langton's Ant consists of two structures: an underlying discrete grid of boolean values - our "field" - and an evolving position on that grid - our "body", more colloquially known as the "ant".
The rules are as follows: Given any iteration, the ant will find itself on either a black or white grid cell. If black, the ant will turn itself $90\degree$ counterclockwise; if white, $90\degree$ clockwise.
Then, the ant will step forth onto the grid cell adjacent to its origin cell in the direction determined by its rotation, and the original cell will have its boolean value toggled - white becomes black, and black white.

Now, what I wanted to do was formulate an analogy for Langton's Ant on a 2-dimensional Euclidean plane with continuous, rather than boolean, values at each point. 
Seeing as the position of the body can be conceptualized by concatenating rotating step-arrows, it can be easily represented in terms of complex exponentials:

$$x_{n+1}=x_n+e^{i(\frac{\pi}{2}-\pi\phi_{n}(x_n)+\theta_n)}  [\\mathrm{I}]$$

Where $x_n$ is the position of the body at iteration $n$, $\phi_{n}(x_n)$ is the the value of the underlying scalar field at point $x_n$, and $\theta_n$ is whatever the angle accumulated by the last iteration was.
Note that if $\phi_{n}(x_n)=0$ the exponential rotates by $\frac{pi}{2}$ radians counterclockwise, and the same amount clockwise if $\phi_{n}(x_n)=0$, preserving the actions of white and black on the original Langton's Ants as those of 1 and 0 respectively.

$$ \textbf{Part 1: The Body} $$

Now recall that I said that $\theta_n$ is whatever the angle accumulated by the last iteration was. This means that

$$\theta_n=\frac{\pi}{2}-\pi\phi_{n-1}(x_{n-1})+\theta_{n-1}  [\\mathrm{II}]$$

And assuming that $\theta_{0}=0$, we can collapse the recursion to obtain the closed form expression for $\theta_n$

$$\theta_n=\frac{\pi n}{2}-\pi\sum\limits_{j = 0}^{n-1} {\phi_{j}(x_j)}  [\\mathrm{III}]$$

And an analogous formulation of equation $[\\mathrm{I}]$ like so

$$x_{n+1}=\sum\limits_{j = 0}^{n} {e^{i(\frac{\pi (j+1)}{2}-\pi\sum\limits_{k = 0}^{j} {\phi_{k}(x_k)})}}  [\\mathrm{IV}]$$

Though space has been treated as continuous so far, we have still been treating the time parameter $n$ as discrete. However, we can design an analogy for continuous time by converting our summations into integrals

$$x_{\mu}=\int_{0}^{\mu} {e^{i(\frac{\pi \nu}{2}-\pi\int_{0}^{\nu} {\phi_{\rho}(x_\rho)} d\rho)}} d\nu  [\\mathrm{V}]$$

Where $\mu$ is our new and continuous time parameter.

$$ \textbf{Closing Remarks} $$

Progress has been slow, largely due to having little time between my numerous academic, extracurricular, vocational, and social obligations; I hope that I will be able to invest more time into my personal research after I graduate from high school. PLACEHOLDER SENTENCE ABOUT WHERE I'M GOING FROM HERE ON THE PURE MATHS FRONT

Though our equations have been nice and rigorous, it would be nice to see what sort of phenomena arise from them; this is why I created the fish.py program. And sure enough, fish.py reveals a trajectory of gradual precession and shifting eccentricity, which is very reminiscent of the trajectory of Mercury under the Schwarzschild metric, suggesting a connection (no pun intended) to differential geometry; this isnâ€™t too far-fetched, since the mutual interaction between the body and the scalar field determining its trajectory is greatly analogous to the correspondence between the stress-energy tensor and spacetime curvature. Thus, cellular automata may provide an illuminating perspective on physics concerning curved fields such as general relativity, Berry curvature, and quantum gravity.
